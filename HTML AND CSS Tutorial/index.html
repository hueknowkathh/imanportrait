            I can't stand to fly
            I'm not that naïve
            I'm just out to find
            The better part of me
            I'm more than a bird,
            I'm more than a plane
            I'm more than some pretty face beside a train
            It's not easy to be me
            I wish that I could cry
            Fall upon my knees
            Find a way to lie
            'Bout a home I'll never see
            It may sound absurd but don't be naïve
            Even heroes have the right to bleed
            I may be disturbed but won’t you concede
            Even heroes have the right to dream
            And it's not easy to be me
            Up, up and away, away from me
            Well, it's alright
            You can all sleep sound tonight

            Digging for kryptonite on this one way street
            Only a man in a funny red sheet
            Looking for special things inside of me
            Inside of me, inside of me [2x]
            I’m only a man in a funny red sheet
            I’m only a man looking for a dream
            I’m only a man in a funny red sheet
            And it's not easy.
            It's not easy to be me. I can't stand to fly
            I'm not that naïve
            I'm just out to find
            The better part of me
            I'm more than a bird,
            I'm more than a plane
            I'm more than some pretty face beside a train
            It's not easy to be me
            I wish that I could cry
            Fall upon my knees
            Find a way to lie
            'Bout a home I'll never see
            It may sound absurd but don't be naïve
            Even heroes have the right to bleed
            I may be disturbed but won’t you concede
            Even heroes have the right to dream
            And it's not easy to be me
            Up, up and away, away from me
            Well, it's alright
            You can all sleep sound tonight
            I'm not crazy or anything
            I can't stand to fly
            I'm not that naïve
            Men weren't meant to ride
            With clouds between their knees
            I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
